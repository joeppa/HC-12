# HC-12 SI4463 433mhz arduino WiFi project 
Hi! Nice that you're looking at this project! I have a bit of experience with domotica so every help is welcome to create a code!

I want to command a waterpump for my drip irrigation system to water my plants via my smartphone with this setup, because there is no WiFi in my garden.

Z-wave or Zigbee procotols are quiet nice, but it could be cheaper right? Thats why I chose for the HC-12 SI4463 module. With a good antenna the range could be more then 1km long! Of course my garden is not that big, but it looks like a great challenge to me.

The intention is to command my Arduino uno r3 atmega328p+esp8266 via my smartphone, so that the wifi Arduino sends a signal via the HC-12 modules to the second Arduino that activates a relay to switch on a waterpump.

25-05-2018: I currently ordered all the parts so I have to wait..

09-07-2018: Fixed the antennas for the HC-12 modules on the housings and still waiting for the remaining parts.
